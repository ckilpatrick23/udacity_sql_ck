# README: My Udacity Business Analytics NanoDegree SQL Project
**Description:** Example of using SQL code from Project 2 of Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree

## About

(2023) This project comes from Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree program. The purpose of the courses in this track is to obtain foundational skills in using Excel, SQL, and Tableau. In this project, Udacity provided us students with a sample dataset of an online music store named Chinook located in Canda. Instructions included creating tables to solve our own questions about the database using at least 2 different tables with `JOIN` and creating a column for aggregations. 

## Getting Started

This repository includes a .sql file with 3 different queries intended to be performed on the sample data given for the 2nd project found in Udacityâ€™s Business Analytics course. To run these queries, the chinook db database can be downloaded from this repo. 

The code blocks found inside of the queries.txt file can be used to generate the following tables:

### Queries

- **By Country: Ratio of Sales Representatives to Customers vs. Number of Invoices**
- **Artist Frequency Across Playlists**
- **Purchases of Metal Tracks by U.S. Customers from 2009-2013**
- **Latin Music Sales by Countries Repesented by Chinook Customers from 2009-2013**

## Additional Notes

**Purpose:** This repository is meant to speak to my skillset by serving as an example of SQL Code. Please feel free to review and reach out to me.
