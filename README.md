# README: My Udacity Business Analytics NanoDegree SQL Project
**Description:** Example of using SQL code from Project 2 of Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree

## About

(2023) This project comes from Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree program. The purpose of the courses in this track is to obtain foundational skills in using Excel, SQL, and Tableau. In this project, Udacity provided us students with a sample dataset of an online music store named Chinook located in Canda. Instructions included creating tables to solve our own questions about the database using at least 2 different tables with `JOIN` , and aggregation functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.).

## Getting Started

This repository includes a .sql file with 4 different queries performed on the sample data. To run these queries with a SQL application:
1. The chinook.db database is available for download in this repo
2. The ck_queries.txt files include 4 different blocks. You can select the code from the in between the `\*QUERY*\` title and the `\*END*\` comment to generate the tables

### Queries
The code blocks found inside of the queries.txt file can be used to generate the following tables:

- **By Country: Ratio of Sales Representatives to Customers vs. Number of Invoices**
- **Artist Frequency Across Playlists**
- **Purchases of Metal Tracks by U.S. Customers from 2009-2013**
- **Latin Music Sales by Countries Repesented by Chinook Customers from 2009-2013**

You can see the results of each query as a chart [here](udacity_sql_ck/UDCTY_Project2_Ciero Kilpatrick.pdf).

## Additional Notes

**Purpose:** This repository is meant to speak to my skillset by serving as an example of SQL Code. Please feel free to review and reach out to me.
