# My Udacity Business Analytics NanoDegree SQL Project
Example of using SQL code from Project 2 of Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree

## Getting Started

This repository includes a .sql file with 3 different queries intended to be performed on the sample data given for the 2nd project found in Udacityâ€™s Business Analytics course. To run these queries, the chinook db database can be downloaded from this repo. 

The code blocks found inside of the queries.txt file can be used to generate the following tables.

### Queries

- By Country: Ratio of Sales Representatives to Customers vs. Number of Invoices
- Artist Frequency Across Playlists
- Purchases of Metal Tracks by U.S. Customers from 2009-2013
- Latin Music Sales by Countries Repesented by Chinook Customers from 2009-2013
